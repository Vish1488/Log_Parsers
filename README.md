This project automates the process of parsing and analyzing SSH authentication logs to detect potential brute-force attacks, reconnaissance attempts, and suspicious login activities.

It extracts key patterns such as:

Invalid login attempts

Failed password attempts

Repeated access from the same IP

Possible break-in attempts

The script processes raw logs and generates a summarized report for security monitoring and analysis.

Features: 
* Extracts and counts invalid login attempts
* Aggregates failed logins by IP address
* Highlights top offending IPs
* Generates a clean, human-readable report
* Easily extendable to include:

**How It Works**

The script reads the SSH log file from logs/auth.log.

It uses regular expressions (regex) to match lines that contain Invalid user or other suspicious login patterns.

Each matching IP address is counted using Pythonâ€™s collections.Counter.

Results are sorted and written into a report (reports/report.txt) showing the top 50 suspicious IPs by failed login count.


Example Use Cases

Detecting brute-force login attempts on SSH servers

Tracking reconnaissance patterns before an attack

Identifying repeat offender IPs

Automating log analysis for security monitoring
